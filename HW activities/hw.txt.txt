wCat is a clone of cat command available in bash but not in windows cmd.

It is used to display or make a copy content of one or more files in the terminal 


General Syntax:
wcat [options] [files]
option to remove big line break (-s)
option to add line number to non empty lines (-b)
option to add line numbers to all lines (-n) 
Commands:
1- node wcat.js filepath => displays content of the file in the terminal 
2- node wcat.js filepath1 filepath2 filepath3... => displays content of all files in the terminal(contactinated form) in the given order.
3- node wcat.js -s filepath => convert big line breaks into a singular line break
4- node wcat -n filepath => give numbering to all the lines 
5- node wcat -b filepath => give numbering to non-empty lines
We can mix and match the options.


Edge cases:
1- If file entered is not found then it gives file does not exist error.
2- -n and -b are 2 options which are mutually exclusive so if user types both of them together only the first enter option should work.



**Ignore**
6- node wcat filenamepath > filename2path => put all the content of filename into filename2 by overriding and also creates filename2 if it doesn't exist.
7- node wcat filename >> filename2 => append all the content of filename into filename2
8- node wcat -s filename > filename2 =>get the file content of filename remove large spaces and save the output in filename2
