# Facts
* promise is just another way of doing async programming
* promise is a token that represents a future value.
* future value inside that promise is determined by the function that   returns the promise.

* promise -> initial state -> pending.
* promise -> 
            final state -> 
                        resolved -> you have got the future value.
                        rejected -> error.
